## dzaima's Java GUI library thing

Undocumented besides whatever very few comments are in the source code.

`./build.py && ./run` runs `src/dzaima/ui/apps/ExMain.java`. An argument of `example/foo.dzcfg` will run the given example in the example folder. `./run keys` will print the canonical form of all keypresses.
